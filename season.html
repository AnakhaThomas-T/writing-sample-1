        <h2>What is the best Season to visit Kerala?</h2>
        <p>Kerala is among the most beautiful tourist destinations in India, and it has something to offer all year-round. However, the best Kerala season for tourism is during the winter season, from December to February. Many tourists also come to Kerala in October-November, during the north east monsoon season.

            Kerala tourism season, thus, begins in October and ends towards March. It is the peak season; and the best time to visit Kerala.
            
            From October to March, the plains and coastal areas have a comfortable climate and refreshing weather. So, whether you want to stroll around the beaches, explore magnificent temples of Kerala or go for wildlife safaris, the winter season offers a perfect opportunity to do so. You can also visit hill stations to enjoy the panoramic misty views of nature.
            
            The summer season and south-west monsoon season are off season for Kerala tourism. But monsoon is considered as the Kerala houseboat season. As the rivers start overflowing, the houseboat cruises in the backwaters of Kerala offer enchanting views of the region.
            
            Monsoon is also the cheapest season to visit Kerala and get Ayurvedic treatments. Hotels, resorts and homestays provide hearty discounts and lucrative offers for the tourists. And you can save on air tickets too.
            
            Also, there are fewer tourists during the monsoon season of Kerala. So, you can relax at beaches, enjoy a serene trip to the backwaters and get unhindered views of the lush green hills during this time.</p>

        <h2>How to reach Kerala?</h2>
        <p>Kerala is a beautiful tropical state in the southern part of India. It boasts of beaches, hills, waterfalls and a variety of wildlife. It is also known for its colourful festivals and tongue-tingling cuisines.

            And Kerala is accessible from all parts of the country and the world.</p>
            
           <p><b>By Road</b> – A road trip along the coastal sands is the best way to reach Kerala. A network of highways connects it to the rest of India. Major cities like Kochi and Trivandrum are about 2500 km away from Delhi, 1500 km from Mumbai and about 500 km from Bangalore. And you can drive your car or hire a cab from all the major cities. Regular buses, from standard seaters to luxury sleeper coaches, are also available from nearby towns to Kochi, Trivandrum, Munnar and other major tourist destinations of Kerala.</p>
            
           <p><b>By Rail</b> – A train journey to Kerala also guarantees a memorable experience along the coastline of the state. Trains are the most convenient and comfortable way to reach Kerala. They reach everywhere except for the hilly areas, and they run from all major cities and towns of the country. Express trains are available to the main railway stations like Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Kozhikode, Kottayam and Thiruvananthapuram among others. You can also book luxury trains like Maharaja’s Express and the Golden Chariot to enjoy the mesmerising views and explore the landmarks of Kerala.</p>
            
           <p><b>By Air </b>– Kerala has four international airports which make it easy to explore the amazing places. Airports at Trivandrum and Cochin are among the busiest ones, and they connect Kerala to all the major airports in the country. You’ll also find regular flights from international destinations like Colombo, Dubai and Singapore. Trivandrum International Airport is the oldest airport and connects coastal landmarks like Kovalam to the world. It is also close to hill stations like Munnar. Cochin International Airport is the busiest airport in the state. It connects you to the backwaters in Alleppey and Kumarakom, and the hilly areas too. Kozhikode airport and Kannur airport are the two other airports in Kerala providing convenient connectivity to other places.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="season">
        <h2>How to travel within Kerala?</h2>
        <p>Whichever airport or railway station you arrive at, you’ll find plenty of buses, taxis and private cabs to connect to your next destination. And if you plan to bring your car or drive a rental, you can take it to anywhere within the state. Buses, flights and trains also connect one place to the other within Kerala.

            In many cities, rental bikes too, are available to explore the region and dive into the spectacular views. Motorboats and ferries also connect many places through the water channels. In Kochi, you can ride the metro trains to explore the culture of the city.
            
            However, the best way to explore all the popular places to visit in Kerala in the most comfortable manner is to hire a cab from top car rental companies in Kerala.
